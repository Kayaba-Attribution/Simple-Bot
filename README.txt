This project was inspired by JetBrains Academy

Simple Bot helped me to understand functions in python.
Simple Bot 2 changes the function test() to make it simpler.
Simmple Bot 3 adds a new funcion that guesses the number that the user is thinking about.
Simple Bot 4 adds a simple calculator because most of the user dont know what is the remainder of their age lol

At the moment simple bot does the following tasks:

1. It gives it name and age
2. Ask the user their name
3. It guesses the user name by using the remainders (will change it in the future)
4. It gives you a handy calculator
5. It guesses the number that the user is thinking about.
4. It proves the user it can count up till the number he enters
5. Asks you some random stuff
6. Tells you to have a nice day!
